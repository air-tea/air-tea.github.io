I am a 4rd-year PhD candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I'm supervised by Prof. [Fangxin Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangfangxin/index.html) at the Intelligent Network and Multimedia Laboratory (INML). Prior to joining CUHK(SZ), I completed my Bachelor degree in Communication Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology, where I was supervised by Prof. [Rui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AyWKyZ4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

My research interests lie in LLM reasoning and LLM agent as well as applications of LLM in distributed system. I’m always open to collaboration—feel free to reach me at panlongwu@link.cuhk.edu.cn

### Research Interests
- Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
- LLM agent 
- Applications of LLM in distributed systems
